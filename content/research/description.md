On a broad perspective our research is focussed at the dynamics of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems. Much in the spirit of Feynman's concept of quantum simulation we develop ideas how to use well-controlled model systems, such as atoms at ultracold temperatures, to approach problems from condensed matter and high energy physics. For this we develop analytical and numerical tools to model and simulate these systems and search for efficient ways to prepare and probe interesting quantum states of matter. A list of current research interests can be found below. For those who want to dive in deeper, feel free to have a look at our recent [publications](/publication).
