title: 'Quantum and classical networks'
subtitle: 'Summer semester 2019'
summary: "Machine learning techniques, especially the ones building on deep neural networks, have been proven extremely useful for tasks like recognizing objects in images, finding clusters in high dimensional datasets, or optimizing stock market investment strategies. In recent years, these techniques have also found multiple applications in various areas of physics research. This seminar will give an overview of these recent developments with a strong bias towards topics in quantum physics. We will explore both the basics of the applied machine learning techniques and the background of the physics topics they have been applied to."

Machine learning techniques, especially the ones building on deep neural networks, have been proven extremely useful for tasks like recognizing objects in images, finding clusters in high dimensional datasets, or optimizing stock market investment strategies. In recent years, these techniques have also found multiple applications in various areas of physics research. This seminar will give an overview of these recent developments with a strong bias towards topics in quantum physics. We will explore both the basics of the applied machine learning techniques and the background of the physics topics they have been applied to.

We divided the topics into three blocks according to the three machine learning paradigms of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Each block starts with a presentation that gives an overview of the machine learning techniques used in this block, which will be less directly physics related. However, we expect the speaker within each block to coordinate such that the relevant techniques for the other presentations are covered and redundancy is avoided. For the introductory talks it might be nice to also show demos of computer codes.


Each presenter should arrange a meeting with one of us at least 2 weeks prior to the talk to clarify the contents. In the week prior to the presentation a rehearsal talk will be scheduled.

Requirements for obtaining 6 CPs for the seminar: Oral presentation during one session of the seminar, as well as a written report/documentation on the topic of the talk. The report may contain up to 2000 words text plus figures if appropriate and should be handed in two weeks after the presentation at the latest.
