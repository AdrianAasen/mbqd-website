This lecture gives an introduction to topics related to quantum computing and quantum information theory. Video material will be complemented by homework exercises, including programming exercises, and tutorial sessions.

Topics include:
- Quantum circuit model: states, operations and measurement
- Quantum algorithms
- Quantum computational complexity classes
- Quantum channels, noise and decoherence
- Quantum error correction and fault tolerant quantum computing
- Quantum computing hardware overview
- Quantum information theory: basic concepts

Dates and time: Mondays 14-16h, online on zoom (link will we provided in the exercise group system)

Courese requirements: Basics knowledge of quantum mechanics (Theoretical Physics IV) and basic programming skills are required.

Mode of examination: The grade will be based on a written exam.

Literature:
- Nilesen and Chuang: Quantum computation and quantum information 
- Watrous: The Theory of Quantum Information
- Wilde: From Classical to Quantum Shannon Theory
- Bengtsson: Quantum Computation: A Computer Science Perspective
