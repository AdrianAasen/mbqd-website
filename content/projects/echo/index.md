During the last few decades the field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics has seen overwhelming advances in preparing and controlling ensembles of atoms on the level of their quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. Recently, it has been shown that the engineering of the quantum mechanical evolution can be taken to the point of time-reversing the entire evolution of an interacting quantum system ([Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 013001 (2016)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.013001), [Nat. Phys. 13, 781â€“786 (2017)](https://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v13/n8/full/nphys4119.html)). This new capability opens the door to various applications, ranging from quantum enhance precision measurement to fundamental questions about the thermalization of closed quantum systems, and verification of quantum simulators. We seek to develop a better understanding of how time-reversal protocols can be used for accessing properties of quantum systems out of equilibrium such as their correlations and entanglement ([arXiv:1706.01616](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01616)).

Our goal is to device protocols that allow to measure the dynamic structure factor in and out of equilibrium using novel techniques for manipulating BECs.
