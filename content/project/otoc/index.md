An interacting quantum many-body system can be characterized by analyzing its response to a weak perturbation. In the case of a spinor BEC this could be a small rotation of the collective spin. By observing the dynamics of the system following such a perturbation, i.e. the spatial and temporal correlations that develop, one can extract the dynamic structure factor, a key quantity in linear response theory. Knowledge of the dynamic structure factor provides a complete picture of the emerging quasi-particle modes in the many-body system, their excitation energy, lifetime and mean occupation number.

Our goal is to device protocols that allow to measure the dynamic structure factor in and out of equilibrium using novel techniques for manipulating BECs.
