Artificial neural networks have proven extremely successful for machine learning tasks such as computer vision and speech recognition. Recently, reinforcement learning techniques have been applied for calculating the ground states and time evolution of quantum many-body problems (Science 355, 602 (2017)). Motivated by these findings we try to develop novel numerical techniques for solving the quantum many-body problem using machine learning techniques with a focus on artificial neural networks.
