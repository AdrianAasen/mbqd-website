abstract: 'Summary Recent research has demonstrated the usefulness of neural networks
  as variational ansatz functions for quantum many-body states. However, high-dimensional
  sampling spaces and transient autocorrelations confront these approaches with a
  challenging computational bottleneck. Compared to conventional neural networks,
  physical model devices offer a fast, efficient and inherently parallel substrate
  capable of related forms of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we demonstrate
  the ability of a neuromorphic chip to represent the ground states of quantum spin
  models by variational energy minimization. We develop a training algorithm and apply
  it to the transverse field Ising model, showing good performance at moderate system
  sizes (N{$\leq$}10). A systematic hyperparameter study shows that performance depends
  on sample quality, which is limited by temporal parameter variations on the analog
  neuromorphic chip. Our work thus provides an important step towards harnessing the
  capabilities of neuromorphic hardware for tackling the curse of dimensionality in
  quantum many-body problems.'
