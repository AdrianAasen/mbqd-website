abstract: 'Quantum entanglement has been identified as a crucial concept underlying
  many intriguing phenomena in condensed matter systems, such as topological phases
  or many-body localization. Recently, instead of considering mere quantifiers of
  entanglement such as entanglement entropy, the study of entanglement structure in
  terms of the entanglement spectrum has shifted to a focus leading to new insights
  into fractional quantum Hall states and topological insulators, among others. What
  remains a challenge is the experimental detection of such fine-grained properties
  of quantum systems. The development of protocols for detecting features of the entanglement
  spectrum in cold-atom systems, which are one of the leading platforms for quantum
  simulation, is thus highly desirable and will open up new avenues for experimentally
  exploring quantum many-body physics. Here, we present a method to bound the width
  of the entanglement spectrum, or entanglement dimension, of cold atoms in lattice
  geometries, requiring only measurements in two experimentally accessible bases and
  utilizing ballistic time-of-flight (TOF) expansion. Building on previous proposals
  for entanglement certification for photon pairs, we first consider entanglement
  between two atoms of different atomic species and later generalize to higher numbers
  of atoms per species and multispecies configurations showing multipartite high-dimensional
  entanglement. Through numerical simulations, we show that our method is robust against
  typical experimental noise effects and thus will enable high-dimensional entanglement
  certification in systems of up to eight atoms using currently available experimental
  techniques.'
