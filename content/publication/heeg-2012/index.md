abstract: 'A model for the simulation of ensembles of laser-driven Rydberg-Rydberg
  interacting multilevel atoms is discussed. Our hybrid approach combines an exact
  two-body treatment of nearby atom pairs with an effective approximate treatment
  for spatially separated pairs. We propose an optimized evolution equation based
  only on the system steady state, and a time-independent Monte Carlo technique is
  used to efficiently determine this steady state. The hybrid model predicts features
  in the pair-correlation function arising from multiatom processes which existing
  models can only partially reproduce. Our interpretation of these features shows
  that higher-order correlations are relevant already at low densities. Finally, we
  analyze the performance of our model in the high-density case.'
