abstract: 'Modern day quantum simulators can prepare a wide variety of quantum states
  but the accurate estimation of observables from tomographic measurement data often
  poses a challenge. We tackle this problem by developing a quantum state tomography
  scheme which relies on approximating the probability distribution over the outcomes
  of an informationally complete measurement in a variational manifold represented
  by a convolutional neural network. We show an excellent representability of prototypical
  ground- and steady states with this ansatz using a number of variational parameters
  that scales polynomially in system size. This compressed representation allows us
  to reconstruct states with high classical fidelities outperforming standard methods
  such as maximum likelihood estimation. Furthermore, it achieves a reduction of the
  estimation error of observables by up to an order of magnitude compared to their
  direct estimation from experimental data.'
