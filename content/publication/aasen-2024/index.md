abstract: "Quantum technologies rely heavily on accurate control and reliable readout of quantum systems. Current experiments are limited by numerous sources of noise that can only be partially captured by simple analytical models and additional characterization of the noise sources is required. We test the ability of readout error mitigation to correct noise found in systems composed of quantum two-level objects (qubits). To probe the limit of such methods, we designed a beyond-classical readout error mitigation protocol based on quantum state tomography (QST), which estimates the density matrix of a quantum system, and quantum detector tomography (QDT), which characterizes the measurement procedure. By treating readout error mitigation in the context of state tomography the method becomes largely readout mode-, architecture-, noise source-, and quantum state-independent. We implement this method on a superconducting qubit and evaluate the increase in reconstruction fidelity for QST. We characterize the performance of the method by varying important noise sources, such as suboptimal readout signal amplification, insufficient resonator photon population, off-resonant qubit drive, and effectively shortened $T_1$ and $T_2$ coherence. As a result, we identified noise sources for which readout error mitigation worked well, and observed decreases in readout infidelity by a factor of up to 30."
