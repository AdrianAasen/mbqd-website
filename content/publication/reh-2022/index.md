abstract: 'The accurate numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs)
  is a central task in numerical analysis allowing to model a wide range of natural
  phenomena by employing specialized solvers depending on the scenario of application.
  Here, we develop a variational approach for solving PDEs governing the evolution
  of high dimensional probability distributions. Our approach naturally works on the
  unbounded continuous domain and encodes the full probability density function through
  its variational parameters, which are adapted dynamically during the evolution to
  optimally reflect the dynamics of the density. In contrast to previous works, this
  dynamical adaptation of the parameters is carried out using an explicit prescription
  avoiding iterative gradient descent. For the considered benchmark cases we observe
  excellent agreement with numerical solutions as well as analytical solutions for
  tasks that are challenging for traditional computational approaches.'
