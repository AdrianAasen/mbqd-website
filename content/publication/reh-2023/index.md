abstract: 'Neural quantum states are a new family of variational ans√§tze for quantum-many
  body wave functions with advantageous properties in the notoriously challenging
  case of two spatial dimensions. Since their introduction a wide variety of different
  network architectures has been employed to study paradigmatic models in quantum
  many-body physics with a particular focus on quantum spin models. Nonetheless, many
  questions remain about the effect that the choice of architecture has on the performance
  on a given task. In this work, we present a unified comparison of a selection of
  popular network architectures and symmetrization schemes employed for ground state
  searches of prototypical spin Hamiltonians, namely the two-dimensional transverse-field
  Ising model and the J1-J2 model. In the presence of a non-trivial sign structure
  of the ground states, we find that the details of symmetrization crucially influence
  the performance. We describe this effect in detail and discuss its consequences,
  especially for autoregressive models, as their direct sampling procedure is not
  compatible with the symmetrization procedure that we found to be optimal. '
