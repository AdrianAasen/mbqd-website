abstract: 'The dependence of the number of Rydberg excitations in a laser-driven cloud
  of atoms on the interaction strength is found to be affected by the finite size
  of the system. A theoretical model predicting a simple power-law dependence is compared
  with results extracted from a numerical many-body simulation. We find that for finite-size
  systems the numerical results do not agree with the analytical prediction. By individually
  testing the assumptions leading to the theoretical prediction using the results
  from the numerical analysis, we identify the origin of the deviations, and explain
  it as arising from the finite size of the system. Furthermore, finite-size effects
  in the pair correlation function g(2) are predicted. Finally, in larger ensembles,
  we find that the theoretical predictions and the numerical results agree, provided
  that the system is sufficiently homogeneous.'
